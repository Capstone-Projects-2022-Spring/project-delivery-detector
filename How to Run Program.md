## How to Run Program:

Package Recipient:
 So, working with the mindset that we are the user that has ordered and is receiving the package. So, the recipient would buy something online and them opt for the DeliveryDetector method to get their package. Once that is done, they would be redirected to the SellerPortal Website (http://detector-env.eba-epj2ey8y.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)![Website Homepage]

, where they will need to make a username and password login for an account. In this process, they will need to input either or both their email and phone number to be contacted when the box has activity.

 Once that is done, the “company” would send out a designated Delivery Detector Locker box to be set up by the consumer. This will require the user to use the website to connect the locker box to the appropriate Wi-Fi information and a reliable power source for it to work. Once that is complete, the user will be ready to enlist the services of DeliveryDetector. 

Looking from the other side of the interaction, with the delivery person’s point of view, they would also be given special credentials in the form of a QR code that would be sent for them to access the locker box to drop off the package. Their QR code would only work once to open and drop off the package in one interaction. If they were to reuse that QR code, an alert would be sent out to the recipient and even the landlord if they are set up as well. 

The final side of the interaction is the person who is selling the item and is shipping it using the DeliveryDetector service to facilitate that. They would go onto the website and create a sellers account where they will input similar information as a buyer i.e., username, legal name, phone number, email.

Once that is done, they will be sent a QR code to be affixed to the package they are shipping out’s box. The seller would then go to their own locker box, scan the QR code on the box, and then place the package to be picked up by the delivery person in the box.
