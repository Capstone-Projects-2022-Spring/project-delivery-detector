Welcome to your new delivery detector device! Before you can start getting
deliveries, we need to set up your device with WiFi. 

	If you're on Mac all you need to do is...
	-Open your finder
		-Search for terminal, and open the terminal
	-Copy and paste this command
		- cd /volumes/boot/startup && ./main
		- Then hit enter
	-You will be prompted for your WiFi network name and password
		-Once the screen says all done, you can safely eject your
		 SD card and boot your device

Happy Detecting!
